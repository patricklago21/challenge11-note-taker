# Challenge 11: Note Taker 

Need to take some notes? Feel free to use this application. Simply click "Get Started" and add your notes with a title. So far, you can only add notes, but delete functionality will be added shortly.

The frontend of this project was provided by Trilogy Coding Bootcamp and backend routes were written by myself. The project is deployed on Heroku through this link: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/challenge11-note-take
